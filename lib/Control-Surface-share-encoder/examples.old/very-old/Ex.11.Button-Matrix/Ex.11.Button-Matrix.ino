/**
 * @example Ex.11.Button-Matrix.ino
 * 
 * This is an example of the ButtonMatrix class of the Control_Surface library.
 * 
 * Connect a 4 Ã— 3 matrix of buttons with the rows to pins 2, 3, 4 and 5, 
 * and the columns to pins 6, 7 and 8.  
 * Pull-up resistors are not necessary, because the internal ones will be used. 
 * 
 * If you want to be able to press multiple buttons at once, add a diode 
 * in series with each button, as shown in the following schematic:
 * 
 * @image html Button-matrix.svg
 * 
 * The note numbers are specified in the `addresses` array.  
 * Map accordingly in your DAW or DJ software.
