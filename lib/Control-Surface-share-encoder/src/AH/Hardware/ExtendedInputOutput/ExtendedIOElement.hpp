/**
 * @brief   An abstract base class for Extended Input/Output elements.
 *
 * The limited number of IO pins of the Arduino can be extended by
 * adding multiplexers, shift registers, IO expanders, etc.  
 * ExtendedIOElement serves as a base class for all these expanders.
 *
 * The pins of each extended IO element are mapped to a pin number
 * greater than the greatest Arduino pin number.  
 * You can supply this pin number to the IO functions in the ExtIO
 * namespace.  
 * If the pin number corresponds to an actual Arduino pin,
 * the default Arduino IO function (digitalRead, digitalWrite, ...)
 * will be called.  
 * If the pin is not an Arduino pin, it is an extended IO pin number,
 * so the extended IO element that this pin belongs to is looked up,
 * and the IO function for this element is executed with the correct
 * pin number.
 *
 * For example:
 * Imagine an Arduino with 20 pins (e.g. the Arduino UNO).
 * Pins 0 - 19 will correspond to the Arduino pins, and
 * `ExtIO::digitalRead(pin)` will have the exact same effect as
 * the standard `digitalRead(pin)` function (albeit a little slower).  
 * Now, we'll add two 8-channel analog multiplexers, let's call them
 * `mux1` and `mux2`.  
 * The first pin (pin 0) of `mux1` will be extended IO pin number 20,
 * the last pin (pin 7) of `mux1` will be extended IO pin number 27,
 * etc.
 * The first pin of `mux2` will be extended IO pin number 28, you get
 * the idea.
 * If you now call `ExtIO::digitalRead(mux1.#pin (7))` or
 * `ExtIO::digitalRead(27)`, both will be
 * translated to `mux1.digitalRead(7)`.
 *
 * The number of extended IO elements is limited only by the size of
 * `pin_t`. However, looking up the extended IO element for a given
 * extended IO pin number uses linear search, so that might add
 * some noticable overhead for large pin numbers.  
 * 
 * The design here is a compromise: saving a pointer to each extended IO element
 * to find it directly would be much faster than having to search all elements
 * each time. On the other hand, it would require each `pin_t` variable to be
 * at least one byte larger. Since almost all other classes in this library 
 * store pin variables, the memory penalty would be too large, especially on AVR
 * microcontrollers.  
 * Another reason to do it this way, is that this approach is still fast enough
 * to make sure it is not noticable to human users.
