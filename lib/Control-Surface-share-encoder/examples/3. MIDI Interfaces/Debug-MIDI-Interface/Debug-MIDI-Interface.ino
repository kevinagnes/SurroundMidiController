/** 
 * This example demonstrates how to use the MIDI interface for debugging.
 *
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Due, Nano 33, Teensy 3.x, ESP32
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 * - 5: momentary push button (to ground)
 * 
 * The internal pull-up resistor for the button will be enabled automatically.
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * - Upload the sketch and open the Serial monitor.
 * - Set the line ending to new line or new line and carriage return.
 * - When the button on pin 5 is pressed, a MIDI Note On message is sent for
 *   note C4, and you'll see that event printed in the Serial monitor.
 * - When the button on pin 5 is released, a MIDI Note Off message is sent for 
 *   note C4, and you'll also see that in the monitor.
 * - When you type in "90 3C 7F" (without the quotes), and press enter, the 
 *   built-in LED will light up.
 * - When you type in "80 3C 7F", and press enter, the LED will turn off again.
 * 
 * Mapping
 * -------
 * 
 * None.
