/**
 * This example demonstrates the use of shift registers as if they were just
 * normal IO pins. The SPI interface is used because it's easy and fast.
 * 
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Nano 33, Due, Teensy 3.x, ESP8266, ESP32
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 *   - SS:   74HC595 ST_CP
 *   - MOSI: 74HC595 DS
 *   - SCK:  74HC595 SH_CP
 * 
 * Connect an LED (and series resistor) between the first output of the
 * shift register and ground.
 * 
 * Remember to connect the enable pin of the shift register to ground and the 
 * master reset pin to Vcc in order to enable it.  
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * This sketch will blink the LED once a second.
