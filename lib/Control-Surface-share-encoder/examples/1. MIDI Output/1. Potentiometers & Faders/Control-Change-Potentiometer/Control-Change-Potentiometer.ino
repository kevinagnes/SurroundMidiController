/** 
 * This example demonstrates the use of MIDI Control Change potentiometers that
 * can be used for changing effect parameters, volumes, pan and balance
 * controls, etc. It can control almost any knob in your DAW software.
 *
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Due, Nano 33, Teensy 3.x, ESP32
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 * - A0: wiper of a potentiometer
 * 
 * Connect the left terminal of the potentiometer to ground, and the right one
 * to V<sub>CC</sub>.
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * - When you turn the potentiometer, you should receive MIDI Control Change
 *   events, with a value between 0 and 127.
 * - The analog input is filtered, so there shouldn't be any noise on the 
 *   position. If there is, check your wiring, and make sure that the resistance
 *   of the potentiometer isn't too high (10 kÎ© is ideal).
 * 
 * Mapping
 * -------
 * 
 * Select the Arduino as a custom MIDI controller in your DAW, and use the 
 * MIDI learn option to assign the potentiometer to a function.
