/**
 * This examples shows how to use a button matrix to read many switches.
 * 
 * @boards  AVR, AVR USB, Due, Nano 33, Teensy 3.x, ESP32
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 * Connect a 4 Ã— 3 matrix of buttons with the rows to pins 2, 3, 4 and 5, 
 * and the columns to pins 6, 7 and 8.
 * 
 * Pull-up resistors are not necessary, because the internal ones will be used. 
 * 
 * If you want to be able to press multiple buttons at once, add a diode 
 * in series with each button:  
 * @image html Button-matrix.png
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * When you press one of the buttons, a note on event for the corresponding note
 * is sent, when you release it, a note off event is sent.
 * 
 * Mapping
 * -------
 *
 * The note numbers are specified in the `addresses` array.
 * Map accordingly in your DAW or DJ software.
