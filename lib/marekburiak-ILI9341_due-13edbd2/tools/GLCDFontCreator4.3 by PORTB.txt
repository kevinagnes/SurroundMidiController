Changes:

New version of font creator:
Skipped version 3 for no reason
Font creator will give a name for fonts
It will use the name of the font as the name (this can be changed manually)

It will add the font size to the end of the name and if it is bold or italic

E.g. if you create Arial size 16 that is bold it will be called Arial_B_14pt

E.g. if you create Arial size 19 that is bold and italic it will be called Arial_IB_19pt

E.g. if you create Arial size 8 it will be called Arial_8pt

E.g. if you create Comic Sans size 20 and rename it to "Best font ever" it will be called Best Font Ever_20pt

Exporting fonts will use the name of the created font and add .h extension to the end of the file
You can now export a font in many sizes without having to use a macro program
Mass exported fonts will be put into a folder to avoid mess

Can now import the same font in many sizes
Removed 'edit font settings', as it did nothing
New font editor windows don't move all over the place anymore

Font creator now chooses the font properly...
Now saves manually exported font to location specified
